Bird</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;For you, dear Verna, reaches my poor heart,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">but only clutches air where you once perched;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the arrow&rsquo;s point would likely have done its part</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if only you were there to feel its burn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stone by the lake where looked for trout</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">did fail you so you flew away too soon;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">my love cannot feed you like the lake&rsquo;s trout,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so once again I&rsquo;m left alone to swoon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But soon you&rsquo;ll come again to look for food;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">you&rsquo;ll find a letter folded there instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A message you may find abrupt or crude,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">will open itself and aloud will read:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;You&rsquo;re the most beautiful creature I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Verna, oh Verna, will you marry me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Peter jumped off the stool and collapsed onto his solar system rug. He stayed there, a tangled mess on the ground, listening to the deep silence outside. The lake house was the only property around for another two miles down the road so he was used to the quiet, but the fog muffled even the sounds of the lake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving his poem lying on the floor by Saturn, Peter stood up, walked over to his desk, and took a seat, scouting for Verna through his bedroom window. It was a nervous tick, the way he took quick glances outside all day. Growing antsy after a few moments, he called, &ldquo;Verna!&rdquo; Only a chill whispered through his window, taunting him like a secret. If Verna were out there, the fog would never tell.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Peter&rsquo;s fingers traveled to the mug sitting at the corner of his desk. His late grandfather&rsquo;s old watch hung on its brim and a tall, blue feather stood inside. The muddled light from the window made the two reflect off each other, emanating a bluish gold. The watch had never worked, even when it belonged to his grandfather. As far as Peter knew, it had been handcrafted to always read 8:47. His grandfather used to say, </span><span class="c6">&ldquo;What good is the time anyway? Time, watches, they&rsquo;re ornaments, a way of dressing the world up in little tutus.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;Peter put the watch on and ran his finger along its face as a way of polishing it. It&rsquo;s all Peter had left to remember him by. When his parents decided to move into his grandfather&rsquo;s old lake house, he thought he could at least have that, but his parents completely transformed it: renovated it, refurnished it, even added to it. Because they could afford to buy their happiness, they added a sunroom in the back. Peter determined never to step foot in it. </span><span class="c6">You might as well be desecrating his tombstone</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Peter meditated on that, his hand returned to the mug absentmindedly. His small frame huddled over his desk as he smoothed the feather&rsquo;s blue barbs until they ran evenly, as if to say, &ldquo;Verna, give me a chance.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was 4:30 p.m. Peter still had the house to himself for a half hour before Barry, his dad&rsquo;s college buddy from Salisbury, arrived. Peter met him a few years before at a restaurant in Baltimore. Even though it was a nice restaurant, Barry wore oil stains all over his blue three-button collar shirt and cargo shorts. Even the cloth napkins looked nicer than him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Barry and his dad got on well enough. His dad kept calling him &ldquo;you damn cheat,&rdquo; though it sounded more like a compliment. Peter just couldn&rsquo;t understand him, couldn&rsquo;t figure out his eyes. They flicked around the restaurant constantly, as if he were waiting for the right moment to rob the place blind, as if in a few moments, he&rsquo;d hold everyone in the place hostage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And those shifty eyes were on their way to Peter&rsquo;s little lake house in South Carolina. ETA: 5 p.m. Peter&rsquo;s dad wouldn&rsquo;t be home from work until 7:00, and his mom not until 11:30. Two hours alone with the cheat. </span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">2:20</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why do you have to work?&rdquo; Peter asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have this conversation, Peter.&rdquo; His mom was doing her final check before heading out the door, wearing the cold expression of an anesthesiologist. She was in the kitchen, though it was practically the same room as the living room where Peter sat; the only thing that separated them was a long stretch of counter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he just come after 7?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be that way.&rdquo; She wiped the already clean counter down and hung the dish towel over the faucet. &ldquo;This means a lot to your father, so please just behave.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just asking. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Peter.&rdquo; She picked up her purse and headed to the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But why did you have to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>They never explained things to Peter. He was lower level management, given only enough information to keep things tidy. </span><span class="c6">The grand scheme is a commodity for parents, teachers, and the dentist, and they can all suck it</span><span class="c1">. Right after thinking it, he ran to his frog backpack and pulled out his notepad to write it down. The front cover had a little Albert Einstein sticker on the corner and &ldquo;FORGET THE REST&rdquo; written diagonally across in thick, black marker. The notepad was almost full, mostly with notes about Verna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter shoved the notepad into his back pocket. One day, he would recite his poems to Verna and on that same day, he swore he&rsquo;d propose. There wouldn&rsquo;t be a ceremony, a witness, or any of that. Just a proposal and maybe dinner. Verna could swallow a striped bass and Peter would down a few pretzels. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Verna, please. It&rsquo;s not as bad as you think.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She stood her ground and retracted her neck into an &ldquo;S&rdquo; shape. She was standing on a big stone edging the lake and could look at him at eye level. &ldquo;Petey, I&rsquo;m way too old for you. You&rsquo;re only thirteen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re eight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s young for humans, but for a heron, that&rsquo;s middle-aged. If I don&rsquo;t have chicks soon, I might be risking never having any!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What? Two weeks ago, you said you never wanted kids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So in two weeks&rsquo; time, you decided that you want to have kids?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s equivalent to three months for a bird, honey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter sighed. &ldquo;This is too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verna extended her neck and looked up past Peter&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Maybe you can spend more time trying to make friends. You know, with humans, and people your age.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want new friends. They&rsquo;d end up leaving me too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verna snapped her bill down at Peter. &ldquo;Peter, don&rsquo;t try to make me feel like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. My grandfather was my only friend, he left me. Now you&rsquo;re leaving me. Everyone&rsquo;s going to leave me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be that way. You&rsquo;re taking things way too far.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand what I did. Why are you leaving me?&rdquo; They stood in silence for a few moments. Then Peter muttered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not&hellip; I mean, you haven&rsquo;t met someone, have you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Verna stood tall and flapped her wings violently, jerking her neck back and forth. &ldquo;What? I can&rsquo;t believe you would even! I would never&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;!&rdquo; Her squawks sounded like grating metal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Verna, don&rsquo;t overreact, I just wanted to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, Peter! You crossed the line, and I don&rsquo;t even want to hear it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flew away before Peter could say anything more.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The front door banged three times. </span><span class="c6">He&rsquo;s twenty minutes early</span><span class="c1">. Peter walked down the hall toward the living room, trying to ignore his parents&rsquo; wedding photos and the big collage of their vacation to Hawaii. There was nothing left of his grandfather except for his sepia-toned navy portrait with a wilting garland of daisies hung around the frame. Since he was buried all the way in Oregon, Peter&rsquo;s parents bought a garland for his portrait every year on his death anniversary. Peter didn&rsquo;t care for the tradition. It only took a day or two for the flowers to start smelling like dust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Peter walked through his living room to the door and opened it. Behind the tattering net of the screen door stood a tan, almost brown man who stood at about 6&rsquo;3&rdquo;. </span><span class="c6">Holy smokes</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is Barry here?&rdquo; the man asked, raking his hand along his stubble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter&rsquo;s vision pulsed to readjust to his current situation. The man wore faded jeans and a loose yellow button up that hung low on his scrawny frame. The top three buttons were undone and his thick, gold chain glimmered against his silver chest tuft. Peter tried to look at his eyes to see if they were friendly, but the man&rsquo;s sunglasses only reflected his own nervous expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a friend of his,&rdquo; the man continued. &ldquo;He told me to meet him here.&rdquo; The man rubbed his hand along his buzzed, gray head. Peter never trusted a widow&rsquo;s peak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You must have the wrong house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man looked around, then eyed Peter carefully. &ldquo;Could you direct me to another house in the area I could check?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter fingered the fraying corner of the netting on the screen door. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a house about a mile or two down the street.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man sighed. &ldquo;Then this must be the house.&rdquo; He stepped back from the door and stretched. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only here to see him since he&rsquo;s in the area.&rdquo; He moved off the porch and carefully wrapped his bike lock around the bike frame and one of the porch posts. &ldquo;Do you mind if I wait here for him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Peter didn&rsquo;t say anything. </span><span class="c6">This is not in the job description</span><span>. </span><span class="c6">This guy is not in the customer demographic. Mom, how the hell am I supposed to deal with this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can wait out here,&rdquo; he continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can sit on the porch swing,&rdquo; Peter decided out loud. The porch swing was already rocking slightly, cutting its own space out in the fog. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; The man moved to the swing. His footsteps resonated throughout the floor and up into Peter&rsquo;s heart, racing his blood through his arteries like antelope. The man sat and swung his feet up onto the wood, resting his back against the swing chain. &ldquo;Do me a favor, will you? I&rsquo;m thirsty as hell and need a glass of water. Could you get one for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter figured if he was going to accommodate a space for him, he might as well be a host. He walked into the kitchen and, while pouring water from the tap, watched the man through the window. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And would you mind putting some ice in it?&rdquo; he yelled through the window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter brought the ice water out to him, and stood there next to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks, kid.&rdquo; He moved his neck around like he was inspecting the place, satisfied, as evident by his slight grin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you wearing sunglasses? It&rsquo;s foggy out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re really just for decoration. Do you want me to take them off?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter felt the weight of his watch on his wrist. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man took four large gulps from his glass of water. It sounded like he was drowning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, kid?&rdquo; He set the glass on the ground next to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Shit</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Rosie.&rdquo; He rolled up his shirt sleeves and revealed a tattoo of a whale with a rose for a tail. The bulge of a long vein ran through the whale&rsquo;s underbelly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your real name&rsquo;s Rosie?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a nickname.&rdquo; He took his sunglasses off and hung them on his necklace. &ldquo;My real name is Chad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter leaned on the railing of the porch and it was from this angle he noticed a black backpack sitting by the door. It had a patch on the front that said, &ldquo;Stand your ground.&rdquo; He was going to ask about it, but also from this angle, he noticed Chad&rsquo;s socks. He had on one argyle sock and one navy blue. &ldquo;Why do you wear two different socks?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I lost both matching socks, so I turned these into a pair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter laughed. He jumped up onto the railing and sat leaning against the post. His parents always warned him against doing it, but he knew it was just one of those superfluous parenting obligations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How old are you, kid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me kid. My name&rsquo;s Peter. And don&rsquo;t call me Pete either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, Peter. How old are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thirteen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Seventh grade?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Eighth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad tensed his brow. &ldquo;You must get picked on a lot since you&rsquo;re small.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No one bothers me about it. I don&rsquo;t really talk to anyone anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not missing out.&rdquo; Chad sighed and pulled out a cigarette. &ldquo;Do you have an ashtray?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped down off the porch and smoked at the edge of the driveway. Peter moved to sit on the porch step and watched him. Chad surveyed the house, glancing from the porch to the roof to the side yards. His eyes were moving like Barry&rsquo;s, except they didn&rsquo;t look to steal; they looked like they were taking pictures. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">I should go back to my room and watch out for Verna</span><span class="c1">. Peter didn&rsquo;t move, just shifted his weight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>He could hear the faint sound of squealing tires approaching. </span><span class="c6">That must be Barry. Of course his car is shit</span><span>.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The car came around the bend and Peter could make out an old Buick. It used to be a dark blue, it seemed, but the paint was so faded it was hard to tell. The car must have been running on its fifth wind. How could that thing still be going?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Barry parked on the street and grabbed a duffle bag from the passenger seat as he stepped out. He hung it from his shoulder and leaned with it as he walked. It looked like he was wearing the same outfit as last time Peter saw him, but two sizes larger. </span><span class="c6">Man, he got big</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Shit, Barry, you look disgusting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rosie, you bitch, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going. I thought you&rsquo;d be here before me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, I called you early since I knew you weren&rsquo;t driving. Were you waiting long?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No; ten-fifteen minutes. You want a cigarette?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, thanks. I quit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For now.&rdquo; Chad put the cigarette out on his boot and threw the butt on the street. &ldquo;Thanks for agreeing to meet here. Judy would shit if she knew I was still in the business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry looked at Peter and then at Chad. &ldquo;Is that Chuck&rsquo;s kid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Charles&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Peter said.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry didn&rsquo;t look directly at him, but fixed his eyes toward him without moving his head. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have gotten taller.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring this, Peter said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to see you, Barry. Would you like a glass of water?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No thanks, maybe later,&rdquo; he said, breath heavy, eyes like clandestine time-bombs. &ldquo;Mind if I head inside?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go right ahead. You&rsquo;re staying in the guest room down the hall to the left by the bathroom.&rdquo;</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Nailed it. I should get paid for this</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Barry said.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad spoke up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading in with him; Barry and I have some business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter didn&rsquo;t say anything. Chad grabbed his backpack on the way inside. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What time did you say Chuck was coming back?&rdquo; Chad asked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; Barry said. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to hit some of this now? It&rsquo;s so good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry shut the guest room door when they got inside.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter stayed rocking on the swing. </span><span class="c6">Easy enough</span><span class="c1">. His parents didn&rsquo;t say he had to entertain him, just let him in the house and offer him refreshments. Now Peter could start on his own business. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walking back down the hall, Peter tried to imagine what the walls used to look like, feeling the absence of the old plaques and photos of their lineage: babies, reunions, and oh so many weddings. It gave the rickety hall the whole must of their ancestry. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter&rsquo;s favorite item was the now missing centerpiece, the Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross his grandfather was awarded for his service in Vietnam. It was a gold anchor on a thin gold chain, hanging from a red thumbtack on a small canvas wrapped in red velvet. Peter used to daydream about his grandfather passing it onto him, pulling the canvas right off the wall and putting it in his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hanging in its place was a portrait of his mother with her head resting on her fist. Her smile and acne-free face were airbrushed like the wall was. Peter hated this wall, more than he hated his parents for losing the anchor. He hated that his grandfather&rsquo;s portrait hung at the far right side of the wall just before entering the living room, as if his grandfather&rsquo;s memory was an afterthought. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I heard of a girl the other day who fell down the drain.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s grandfather said. They were walking around the lake, the red leaves of the big maple struggling to hang on. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, I heard about that. She didn&rsquo;t fall exactly.&rdquo; Peter paused their pace to pick up a stone and threw it into the lake. The rings undulated undisturbed without a single animal, rock, or sand bar poised on the surface to disturb the rhythm. &ldquo;She tethered herself to her shower head using a mountain climbing harness, but as she was descending, the shower head broke out of the wall and she went plummeting down. No one&rsquo;s heard from her in weeks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have a plumber friend who has.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s grandfather took a few steps back and sat on a log he&rsquo;d moved there years ago. &ldquo;He was dismantling the pipes looking for the girl, when he came upon a note in her handwriting. It said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m safe. They&rsquo;re taking good care of me.&rsquo; What do you suppose that means?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Peter moved and squatted next to him. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure it has something to do with the tiny people living in the sewers. There&rsquo;s a legend about them luring children to them with playful music and sweets. The children follow them to a small palace they&rsquo;ve made, with a throne and everything. The tiny people worship them like gods, bringing stolen foods and luxuries like sun hats and monocles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Peter&rsquo;s grandfather eased himself into a sly grin. &ldquo;Well, then I trust she&rsquo;s in good hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to visit them and ask.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Peter&rsquo;s grandfather let out a dry cackle. The lake had resettled and he lost himself in thought looking at it. &ldquo;Look at the lake&hellip; how still it is. It looks like you could walk right through and be in another version of our world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wish I could walk right into it. I&rsquo;d find my stuck-up parents and give them each a big smack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Peter&rsquo;s grandfather laughed until he cried. &ldquo;I got to tell you, Peter, I&rsquo;ve never had so much fun in my life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter walked back to his room and looked into the backyard. The fog was still thick. If Verna were there, she may as well have been in hiding. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>The notepad in his pocket hung heavy. </span><span class="c6">If she doesn&rsquo;t show up today, I&rsquo;m done with her</span><span class="c1">. He paced the length of his room and brooded until he grew too antsy to manage himself. The frustration needed expression. Peter pulled the notepad out of his pocket and moved to his desk. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Fly to heaven, babe,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you take care. Fly to hell,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I&rsquo;ll meet you there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you got there?&rdquo; Chad stood at the door, his sunglasses back on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A haiku.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You like to write, huh?&rdquo; He had a dull smirk on the edge of his lips and his words were blurring together.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really. It&rsquo;s just what I do.&rdquo; Peter closed his notepad and pushed it to the side. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Barry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying down. Tired. Not surprising, he had a long drive.&rdquo; Chad tipped an ice cube from the glass into his mouth and sucked on it for a bit before crunching down on it. &ldquo;Alright, man. It&rsquo;s been fun hanging out, but I&rsquo;ve got to get going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter stood up. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay? I&rsquo;m sure my dad wouldn&rsquo;t mind driving you home. We have an SUV that could fit your bike too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your dad would put bullets in my ass if he knew I was here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know my dad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Knew. We used to be good friends: me, Barry, and your dad. Grew up together, went to college together, all that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter put his pencil back in the mug and picked up his notepad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into the backyard. Want to come for a minute?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He did!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, your dad used to write plays for Salisbury.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter had learned a lot about his dad. He learned that he studied theater, that he used to steal grandpa&rsquo;s liquor, that he gave up a beautiful redhead he knew from his childhood to marry Peter&rsquo;s mom, that he used to be part of a biker gang, that he got the tattoo of a hummingbird on his chest from his friend when he was too drunk to see straight, and that the scar under his eye was from a fight in Atlantic City.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter, I really got to get going. Your dad would lose it if he saw me here. Can you keep it a secret?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter looked out to the lake. The fog and the falling darkness would make it impossible to see Verna. &ldquo;Can I tell you a story first?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad checked his watch. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter cleared his throat. &ldquo;There was a guy named Percy. He inherited a treasure map from his late father, who had been an adventurer. Percy decided, in honor of his father, he&rsquo;d go find the treasure.&rdquo; Peter looked up at Chad who seemed only to be half listening. &ldquo;The map led him to a thick wood in the Amazon rainforest. Just before reaching the spot on the map, he was visited by a goddess who promised him eternal life with her in the heavens if he gave up on finding the treasure. What do you think he did? You choose the ending.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog finally began clearing up, though it was already too dark to see much. &ldquo;He had to choose between eternal life with a goddess and finding some treasure?&rdquo; Chad scratched his fingers through his stubble. &ldquo;Was she hot?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I would&rsquo;ve chosen eternal life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter tensed and stared. &ldquo;But what about the treasure? You&rsquo;d give up on it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I hate surprises.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And your father&rsquo;s honor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;d kick my ass if he knew I decided to chase after some dinky treasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The treasure was his father waiting for him. And he&rsquo;ll go on waiting for eternity.&rdquo; The fog had dissipated, as if Peter&rsquo;s words climbed out of his lungs to blow it away. The lake tried to reflect the world as it always had, but only gave back the darkness it was given.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad grimaced and shook his head. &ldquo;Why did the goddess screw him like that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She was born without a father. She was jealous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s twisted. That&rsquo;s just twisted. If I knew what the treasure was, I would&rsquo;ve picked the treasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the whole weight of the decision. You don&rsquo;t know what it is. It could&rsquo;ve been anything, but you settled.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it. Why are you telling me this story?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ll never see you again, and I wanted to know whether we could&rsquo;ve been friends or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Could we have?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. No one picks the treasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad unrolled his sleeves. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re better off. I&rsquo;m going, Peter. Tell your parents Barry was really tired so he went right to bed, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter said nothing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You stay cool, alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad didn&rsquo;t even get a passing glance as he walked to the front yard. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter stood at the edge of the lake. </span><span class="c6">She&rsquo;s not coming</span><span>. He took out his notepad and looked through, looking for a poem he would&rsquo;ve read to her. He flipped through frantically, not even scanning them, deciding on nothing. </span><span class="c6">Why am I waiting for you anyway?</span><span>&nbsp;He closed the notepad and held it at his side. He thought about Barry inside, passed out on the bed. </span><span class="c6">Fat-ass blowhard. </span><span>He thought about his grandfather, Chad, and his poetry. He gave them all he could, but they didn&rsquo;t budge for him. One was dead, one was an idiot, and one just sat wherever he put it like a paperweight, like sparse flecks of snow that disappear into the ground where they hit. </span><span class="c6">What a waste</span><span>. </span><span class="c6">What good is it anyway?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Peter threw the notepad on the ground and started for the house, but stopped after a few steps. He walked, almost ran back to the edge of the lake and the words burst out of him: </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fly to hell, babe! Forget the rest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The End</span></p><div><p class="c11"><span class="c1">&nbsp;| Patel</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
