            I am an aspiring back-end software engineer with a passion for quality, reliability, and ease of use. 
            As a test engineer and QA engineer, I have owned the delivery of products that meet specification and satisfy customers in a timely manner. 
            Iâ€™d like to bring these experiences to a development role where I can program the logic behind great user experiences and help build scalable processes and tools that reliably and promptly deliver high quality products.
